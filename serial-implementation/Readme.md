Serial implementation
====

This directory contains serial implementation of _Monte Carlo Tree Search_. It was done to have a better understanding of problem, before attempting to create a distributed version. 
Code included represents a two players in a game of Nim - they are both using UCT MCTS strategy. The application will printout who would win. 

Number of iterations of tree search, as well as starting game are fully customizable.

This example was based on explanations and code examples from: [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) research hub.](http://mcts.ai/).
